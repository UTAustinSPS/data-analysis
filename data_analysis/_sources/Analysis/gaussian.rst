The Gaussian Distribution
=========================
The Gaussian distribution, otherwise known as the "Normal distribution" or "bell curve",
is a powerful tool for data analysis, as it is ubiquitous, following from physical principles.

The Function
------------
The Gaussian distribution is most easily understood by its form as a probability density function.
That means that if the distribution is :math:`G(x)`, where :code:`x` is the result we obtained,
:math:`G(x)` is the probability of obtaining that result, meaning that if we integrate
the function over all possible values of :code:`x`, the function should give the value :math:`1`.
