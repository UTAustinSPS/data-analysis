Course Description and Objectives
---------------------------------
This course was devised by the UT-Austin chapter of the Society of Physics Students officers in order to
introduce physics students (and students interested in physics research) to the :math:`\LaTeX` and *Mathematica*
programming languages for use in physics courses. Ideally, this course would be taken by students prior to
PHY 353L, in order to prepare them for the typesetting and data analysis requirements of that course. 
Specifically, by the end of this course, you will be able to: use *Mathematica* to analyze scientific data and
create graphical representations of that data; use :math:`\LaTeX` to construct scientific documents including
images, tables, and hyperlinks, completing assignments under different constraints to familiarize yourself with
aspects of the language; and combine your skills in a final paper.

DemTex
------
This course is being offered through the DemTex program (see description below).

*DemTex courses (UGS 122) are regularly scheduled academic courses that meet 1-hour per week at a time and
location arranged by the School of Undergraduate Studies.

These courses are led by an undergraduate peer facilitator under the supervision of a faculty supervisor. The
grade for the course will be assigned by the faculty supervisor. DemTex courses require active group
participation as outlined in the syllabus. DemTex courses are offered on a pass/fail basis.*

Course Structure
----------------
Each week, the student facilitator will lead an interactive lecture on topics relevant to the objectives above,
wherein students are strongly encouraged to participate by asking questions and requesting aid for
programming-related issues as they arise. Because this course is strongly rooted in programming, many smaller,
broadly-applicable technical issues will be dealt with at students’ request during class, but additional help
will be available by contacting the student facilitator.

Assignments
-----------
During the course of the semester, you will periodically be expected to complete assignments related to the
objectives outlined above. These will need to be completed largely outside of class. As needed, instructions
will be given on how to download any software required to complete assignments, but all required software is
available for use in the Physics Microcomputer Laboratory in RLM 7.306 (
`pmcl.ph.utexas.edu <http://pmcl.ph.utexas.edu/>`_). Expect to receive weekly assignments on topics discussed
the week prior.

A final project will be given in lieu of the last two weekly assignments, the details of which will be provided
later in the semester. This project will be cumulative, incorporating the data analysis skills learned in
relation to the *Mathematica* portion of the course, and the typsetting skills learned in relation to the
:math:`\LaTeX` portion.

Grading Policy
--------------
This is a strictly pass/fail class, so you must get credit for at least 60% of the points listed below in order
to pass. You are encouraged to work together on assignments, but please list the students with whom you consulted
on each assignment along with what you discussed (brevity is encouraged). The final paper, however, will be an
individual project, although general discussion and help with programming errors is perfectly acceptable.

Assignments (each): 5 pts
Final Paper: 70 pts
Attendance: 20 pts
Participation: 10 pts
*There will be no final exam for this course*

Assignments will be graded in accordance to problems/tasks completed as well as use of newly-introduced topics
in some cases. Your lowest two assignment scores will not be included in final grade tabulations. Occasionally,
some assignments may have opportunities to earn more than 5 points in order for students to make up for errors
on previous assignments. The final paper will be graded based on ability to show comprehension of skills
learned throughout the semester, including aspects drawn from each lecture or assignment. Attendance will be
taken each week, but students are allowed two "skip" days each without penalty (see student facilitator for
special circumstances prior to when they arise). Active participation in weekly discussions or evidence of
guiding fellow classmates through the material outside of class will be considered for the participation
portion of the grade.

Assignments are due at the beginning of class (first 3 minutes), the following class after the assignment was
assigned unless otherwise noted. Late assignments receive a penalty of one point per 24-hour period not turned
in (e.g., if the assignment is due at 3:03 on Wednesday, the maximum score the assignment can receive between
3:04 on Thursday and 3:03 on Friday is 3 pts).

The final paper will be due at the end of the final class by email or other prescribed means to the student
facilitator, with only emergency situations excepted.

Tentative Schedule
------------------
This schedule is tentative, due to the potential for questions to dominate the conversation some days. However,
it should serve as a guide to the topics to be discussed through the semester.

**Week 1**  - Introduction to Course; Review of End Goals; Introduction to *Mathematica* and brief diversion to PMCL
**Week 2** - Introduction to *Mathematica* (continued): Simple programs, graphing
