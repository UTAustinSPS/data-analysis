Assignments
:::::::::::
Welcome to the course! This page has the homework assignments and will be updated
throughout the semester. As stated in the syllabus, homework assignments are due
the Wednesday before class at 5pm

Week One (Jan. 16)
==================
"Introduction to *Mathematica*"
-------------------------------
There's a lot of reading this week, but don't feel like you have to master any of it
yet. We want to get you started quickly on topics, but we have to introduce a lot
before you can do anything interesting. You'll likely be reviewing this material through
January 22 to complete the homework for that week. Go ahead and look at the homework
for next week so you can get a feel for how much you'll need to comprehend this week
from the material. We'll return to sections later as we need them, and will often
list them as part of the required reading.

**Reading due by class:**

- `Introduction <intro.html>`_
- `Syllabus <syllabus.html>`_
- `Mathematica Introduction <Mathematica/mathematica.html>`_
- Sections from `Mathematica Document Structure and Syntax <Mathematica/structure.html>`_:

  - `Basic Constructs <Mathematica/structure.html#basic-constructs>`_
  - `Order Matters <Mathematica/structure.html#order-matters>`_
  - `Other Constructs <Mathematica/structure.html#other-constructs>`_
- `Lists <Mathematica/lists.html#lists>`_
- `Functions <Mathematica/functions_graphs.html#functions>`_
  
  - You can ignore the "dummy variable" sidebar (that's why it's a sidebar)

**Assignment due before class this week:** Only the reading! Might browse through the whole book
if you want to see what's ahead, and to see some pretty examples.

Week Four (Feb. 6)
===================
"*Mathematica*: Reading in data, simple analysis"
-------------------------------------------------

This weeks marks the brief shift into applying the structures we've learned about with
*Mathematica* to real problems rather than little toys. Most assignments (including the
one due this week) that have a *Mathematica* component will now have some data associated with
them that you will then use to perform analysis. This week, the assignment is more about graphing
the raw data, but we'll soon move to applying fits to the data, plotting those, plotting
error bars, etc. We'll take a break from *Mathematica* in a couple weeks to learn about
*LaTeX* so we can present our results in a more formal way.

**Reading due by class:**

- `Curve Fitting <Analysis/curve_fit.html>`_
- `Approximations <Analysis/approximations.html>`_

**Assignment due before class this week:** :download:`Assignment 3 <Assignments/assignment3.pdf>`.

**Data file for assignment (9 MB):** :download:`Assignment 3 Data <Assignments/assignment3data.csv>`.

Week Five (Feb. 13)
===================
"*Mathematica*: More advanced data analysis"
-------------------------------------------------

This is the last week of *Mathematica* for a while! We'll begin looking at LaTeX next!

**Reading due by class:**
