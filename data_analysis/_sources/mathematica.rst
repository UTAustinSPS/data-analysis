   <h1><i>Mathematica</i></h1>

Introduction
------------
*Mathematica* is a language and application created by Stephen Wolfram's company, Wolfram Research. As of Fall 2013,
it is in its 9th major version. *Mathematica* is used for a variety of applications and has capabilities for
cluster computing (essentially, having many computers run the same program with different data to solve a problem).
As in most programming languages, you can make the code as general as possible, with a variety of applications,
but in the general case, individual programs are written to solve specific problems. As the name suggests,
*Mathematica* is very good at all sorts of mathematical problems, from integrals and derivatives to
3D data plots to statistical analysis and more (for more, see the 
`Wolfram site <http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/features/application-areas.html>`_). It is a cross-platform application,
meaning that it is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux, but except for special cases, you will need the *Mathematica*
application to do anything (the CDF format - essentially an interactive PDF can be viewed without *Mathematica*, but
it is needed to edit CDFs).

Access
------
If you are a physics student at UT, you can obtain it using a site licence paid for by the university. See the
`Physics Department Software Page <http://www.ph.utexas.edu/~help/software.php>`_ for more.

Otherwise, if you are a UT student, various computer labs, including the PMCL in RLM have *Mathematica* installed
already. If you are not a UT student, you will need to purchase the software from `Wolfram <http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/>`_.
