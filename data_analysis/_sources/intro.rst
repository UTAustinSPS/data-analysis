Introduction to the Introduction
--------------------------------
Welcome! This is a course designed to teach the basics of the :math:`\LaTeX` and *Mathematica* programming
languages in order to better prepare you for UT Austin's PHY 353L (Modern Physics Laboratory) course.

:math:`\LaTeX` is typically used as a "markup" language, which is to say that it takes the place of other
document formatters like *Microsoft Word* in order to create a presentable document in a fairly standard way.
Although *Word* is now better about cross-platform stability, :math:`\LaTeX` is the standard for most physics journals.
:math:`\LaTeX` is based on the :math:`\TeX` language, created by Turing Award winner Donald Knuth. Knuth is
one of the original experts in many parts of computer science, and his *Art of Computer Programming* volumes
are one of the most widely-accepted texts on a variety of subjects. Knuth was disappointed with the
lack of clear, elegant ways of expressing ideas on early displays and created :math:`\TeX` to
be able to have more control. And yes, :math:`\LaTeX` and :math:`\TeX` are the correct ways to typeset the
names of these languages. However, if not available (in code, use ``\LaTeX`` and
``\TeX``), then "LaTeX" and "TeX" will work in a pinch. Lastly, :math:`\LaTeX`
may be pronounced "lay'-tech" or "lah'-tech".

*Mathematica* is a proprietary languaged developed by the *Wolfram* corporation and is both fairly easy
to use, and is the basis for the popular `Wolfram|Alpha <http://www.wolframalpha.com>`_ website. It is by
far not the fastest language for analyzing data, but abstracts many parts that become relevant in languages
like *C* or *Python*. *Mathematica* is extremely flexible and supports large-scale projects, but in many
cases is used for simple one-time applications. It also has typesetting abilities (including presentation-mode)
but in practice it is generally used for its analysis capabilities, with results exported to other programs.

The Course
----------

This course will first go through the beginnings of the :math:`\LaTeX` language, then introduce concepts in
*Mathematica*, followed by several sections on how the two may be combined to produce a clean, elegant,
and interesting final document. Throughout this course, there will be questions to answer, some coding-based
some more traditional question formats. Assignments will be given for students registered for the *DemTex*
program at UT and will be available through the course website listed in the syllabus.
