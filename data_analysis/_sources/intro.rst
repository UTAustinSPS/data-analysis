Introduction to the Introduction
--------------------------------
Welcome! This is a course designed to teach the basics of the :math:`\LaTeX` and *Mathematica* programming
languages in order to better prepare you for UT Austin's PHY 353L (Modern Physics Laboratory) course.

:math:`\LaTeX` is typically used as a "markup" language, which is to say that it takes the place of other
document formatters like *Microsoft Word* in order to create a presentable document in a fairly standard way.
Although *Word* is now better about cross-platform stability, :math:`\LateX` is the standard for most physics journals.
:math:`\LaTeX` is based on the :math:`\TeX` language, created by Turing Award winner Donald Knuth. Knuth is
one of the original experts in many parts of computer science, and his *Art of Computer Programming* volumes
are one of the most widely-accepted texts on a variety of subjects. Knuth was disappointed with the
lack of clear, elegant ways of expressing ideas on early displays and created :math:`\TeX` to
be able to have more control.

*Mathematica* is a proprietary languaged developed by the *Wolfram* corporation and is both fairly easy
to use, and is the basis for the popular `Wolfram|Alpha website <http://www.wolframalpha.com>`_.
