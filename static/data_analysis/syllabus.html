<h1>Course Description<a class="headerlink" href="#course-description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This course was devised by the UT-Austin chapter of the Society of Physics Students officers in order to introduce
physics, math, astronomy, chemistry, and computer science students (and students interested in those and related
subjects) to the <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span> and <em>Mathematica</em> programming languages for use in data analysis. While designed with
preparation for PHY 353L in mind, the skills learned in this course apply to a broad array of courses and
fields of study and are directly applicable to both academic and industrial applications. Students enrolling
in this course would benefit from prior exposure to programming, but no experience is required. This course
is being offered through the Physics Department at UT Austin as PHY 110C.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="learning-outcomes">
<h1>Learning Outcomes<a class="headerlink" href="#learning-outcomes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Use <em>Mathematica</em> to analyze scietific data and create graphical representations of that data</li>
<li>Use <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span> to construct scientific documents including images, tables, and hyperlinks,
completing assignments under different constraints to familiarize yourself with the language</li>
<li>Combine the skills listed above in a final project</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="section" id="course-structure">
<h1>Course Structure<a class="headerlink" href="#course-structure" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This course will largely follow the &#8216;flipped-classroom&#8217; model, involving readings and homework
assignments to be completed outside of class in an effort to make class-time as interactive and
helpful as possible. Each week, students will complete a reading assignment from an online
textbook created for this course by the Evan Ott and Will Beason and edited by the Society of Physics
Students (see the link above). This textbook is largely
technical in nature, presenting new features of <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span> and <em>Mathematica</em> each week. Students will
read the sections of the textbook before class, then begin a programming assignment that will be
due the following week over that material. First-drafts of the programming assignments will be
due the day before class.</p>
<p>During class, students will first present solutions to the assignment they completed for that week
and discuss the merits and failings of particular methodologies used, in a variant of the Moore
model of teaching. Particularly toward the end of the semester, students will engage in a debate over
technologies employed in solutions (is a 3D graph with one axis of time more relatable than multiple 2D
graphs? are in-line equations better for space or too difficult to read? is using built-in
distribution functions more enlightening than re-writing them in a more convenient form?).</p>
<p>The student facilitator will then review topics that proved most challenging for students based on
the first-drafts submitted the previous day and help with troubleshooting errors. Then, each week,
the student facilitator will review the week’s reading material. If time permits, students will
begin work on the next week’s assignment, working collaboratively. An example class agenda can
be found below.</p>
<p>Office hours will be held weekly (time and location to be provided on the first class day) for
students to come ask questions or discuss the week&#8217;s reading.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="assignments">
<h1>Assignments<a class="headerlink" href="#assignments" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Each week, students will be expected to complete assignments related to the objectives outlined
above. These will need to be completed largely outside of class, although students are encouraged
to bring personal computers to class for help with technical issues or for referencing their own
work when discussing solutions. Software to be used in the course will include traditional <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span>
editors (use of <em>LyX</em> is discouraged in favor of students working directly with code), and the
latest edition of <em>Mathematica</em>. As needed, instructions will be given on how to download any
software required to complete assignments, but all required software is available for use in
the Physics Microcomputer Laboratory in RLM 7.306 (<a class="reference external" href="http://pmcl.ph.utexas.edu/">http://pmcl.ph.utexas.edu</a>).</p>
<p>A final project will be given in lieu of the last two weekly assignments. This project will be
cumulative, incorporating the data analysis skills learned in relation to the <em>Mathematica</em> portion
of the course, and the typesetting skills learned in relation to the <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span> portion.</p>
<p>A representative assignment covering the cumulative knowledge gained toward the end of the
semester may be found below.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="grading-policy">
<h1>Grading Policy<a class="headerlink" href="#grading-policy" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This is a strictly pass/fail class, so you must get credit for at least 60% of the points
listed below in order to pass. Students are encouraged to work together on assignments,
but are expected to list the students with whom they consulted on each assignment.
The final project will be an individual project, although general discussion
and help with programming errors is perfectly acceptable and encouraged.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Weekly Assignments (total): 50 pts</p>
<p>Final Project: 24 pts</p>
<p>Solution Presentation and Discussion: 26 pts</p>
<p><em>There will be no final exam for this course</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Weekly assignments are due the day before class at 5pm. Students are encouraged to complete as much of
the assignment as possible by this time so that class-time can be used to discuss solutions and
technical problems. No penalty will be imposed on late assignments, and assignments may be
resubmitted with no penalty until the final class day. Grades for these assignments will be
based on completion of the tasks listed and use of newly-introduced topics.</p>
<p>The final project will be graded based on ability to show comprehension of skills learned
throughout the semester, including aspects drawn from each lecture and assignment. The final
project will be due at the end of the final class by email or other prescribed means to the
student facilitator, with only emergency situations excepted.</p>
<p>Students are expected to present their solutions and actively engage in discussion about each
week. Over the span of the semester, this means that each class will allow for 2 pts based on
engagement, insight, and willingness to present solutions.</p>

<h1>Example Assignment (near end of semester)<a class="headerlink" href="#example-assignment-near-end-of-semester" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Your first goal this week is to read the data in <strong>single.txt</strong> which has points (x,y) in CSV
format. Express this data graphically. From what type of distribution might this have arisen?
(refer to the textbook&#8217;s appendix if you aren&#8217;t familiar with distribution functions)</p>
<p>Fit this distribution function to your data, and plot the data and function on the same graph.
Do you think you were right? Use an appropriate statistical test for the function to determine
if it is likely you have selected the correct distribution.</p>
<p>Once you are satisfied with the choice of distribution, read in <strong>timeseries.txt</strong> which has
points (t,x,y) in CSV format. Can you find a way to (mostly) re-use your code to express this
data? The graphs for <strong>single.txt</strong> should correspond exactly to those for the first timestamp
in <strong>timeseries.txt</strong>, but future times seem to evolve the distribution.</p>
<p>Fit the distribution function to the data at each timestep, then plot each feature of your
statistical model versus time. Are there patterns that emerge? Use the curve-fitting
techniques to derive the evolution of the system over time. Can you think of a physical
situation that might behave in this way?</p>
<p>Finally, combine the graphs, relevant equations, and discussion in a <span class="math">\(\LaTeX\)</span> document.</p>
